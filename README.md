# ender6BTTSKR1.4Turbo
Marlin based Ender6 + BTT SKR 1.4 Turbo configuration


This is my attempt to get my Ender 6 working again after breaking the Creality driver board. I am hoping to make this Ender 6 usable again with a BTT SKR 1.4 Turbo and 2209 drivers. 
Currently when homing the position doubles which I am unsure why this is.
